# Bank Profit/Loss and Voter Polling Analyses with Python

This repo consists of two separate dataset analyses.  

PyBank analyzes the financial records of a specific company, more specifically Profit/Loss over a period of time.

PyPoll analyzes voting results and in the end, records the winning candidate of an election.

Results for both .csv files are then written to a simple .txt file for each.
